-	The web can be accessed via the internet.
-	The web was began as information project at CERN
-	World wide web is the universe of network

-	The web is basically a system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents.

Tim Berners – Lee  
-	Invented the World Wide Web in 1989
-	He wrote the first browser Computer Program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.

2 types of web resources
1.	Static -  already exist
2.	Dynamic – produced on the fly
Spider – application that crawls the web
Application:
1.	Web server – performs the tack of storing 
2.	Web client
Internet network – interconnection

HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL
-	Used to access resources (hypertext/hypermedia) on the World Wide Web
-	Invented by Tim Berners – lee at CERN in 1989
-	Jointly developed by the W3C and the IETF 
-	Version history: 
		-HTTP 0.9 (1991)
		-HTTP 1.0 (RFC 1945 may 1996)

HTTP FUNDAMENTALS
-	HTTP is based on client – server architecture
	Servers:
		-Proxy servers, gateways, tunnels
	Clients, a.k.a. user agents (UA):
		-Web browsers, web crawlers/spiders, other end user tools and applications
	HTTP uses a request
		-The client sends an HTTP request message to the server
		-The server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message.
	HTTP provides support for other functionalities such as:
		-Cache
		-Content media type (MIME) specification
		-Language and character set specification
