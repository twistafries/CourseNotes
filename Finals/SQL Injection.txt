SQL INJECTION

There are many types of attacks that can make our web application,
expose our data and steal them one of the famous and most common type of attack
is an injection this is were the attacker inject some malicious code to our website's
exposing important information such as username and password of the administrator
or some of our users. There are also many types of Injection such as LDAP Injection,
XML Injection,Code Injection, XPath Injection,SSI Injection,ORM Injection, and etc.
And the most common attack of injection is SQL Injection.

SQL injection is the most common of all injection attack because it has a lot of 
issue in database-drive sites.

SQL Injection is  compose of  code that query certain information in the database
and then after that successful attempt  it will exploit sensitive information
from the database where it can modify our data in the database and it an execute
administration operation


Example:

This example below will query all data where the company Id is same to
that is requested. 

	companyId = getRequestString("company_Id");
	querySQL  = "SELECT * FROM company WHERE company_Id = " +companyId;

And then if it doesn't return anything the attacker can also try returning
all the information in the table by using the "OR 1=1" which is a means true

	SELECT * FROM company where company_Id = 217 or 1=1 

PREVENTION OF SQL INJECTION

1.By using Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)
	-It ensures that the attacker will not be able to modify the query, Even if
	its the one who inserted it. and it avoids the "Or 1=1" that return alot of
	info.
2.Stored Procedures
	-It has the same effectiveness of Prepared Statements
	-But it is not always safe from sql injection
3.White List Input Validation
	- Use to validate information that is entered. 
4.Escaping All User-Supplied Input
	-If all 3 Prevention above is not easy then Escaping All User-Supplied Input
	 will be used. Although it is not guaranteed to prevent all SQL injection.
	-This method will not be confused in which SQL code is written by the developer and which
	is not written by the developer
