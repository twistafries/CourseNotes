Servlet Life Cycle
init() -> service() -> destroy()
- init()
	- servlet is created when the client invokes a URL corresponding to the servlet
	- called only once when the servlet is created.
	
- service()
	- handles the HTTP request from the client then responds to the client.
	- checks the request type then call the appropriate method. e.g. GET request then calls doGet method, POST request then calls doPost method, etc.
	
- destroy()
	- called at the end of the cycle.
	- this lets the servlet close connections like connection to the database, stop background threads, perform cleanup activities, etc.
