Server-Side Web Scripting


Java Servlets
	
	- Java objects that are intended to play the role of server components in client-server communication..
	- handles the client requests by generating responses to such requests..

	- part of the Java EE specification (see java Servlet API for more details)..

	-hosted in a 'servlet container' that provides the environment ni which the servlet runs, as well as controls the 'servlet lifecycle'..
	
	*servlet lifecycle:
	
	- instantiation		=> constructor call ..
					- creates an instance of the servlet to service client requests..
					- invoked implicitly by the servlet container when the servlet is called upon to service a client
				  	  request and no instance currently exists..

	- initialization	=> init() method..
					- invoked only once and is intended for any startup initialization code for the servlet ..
	
	- request handling	=> service() method..
					- invoked for each client request..
					  servlet performs whatever logic necessary in order to serve the request and generate a response..
					- multiple client requests are typically handled by a single, multi-threaded sevlet instance, thus,
					  to ensure that the code is being run by the servlet is 'thread-safe'..
	
	- destruction		=>destroy() method..
					- invoked before the servlet instanceis 'unloaded', and is intended for any 'housekeeping' code that the servlet may need to run ..
	


HttpServlet

	- Java servlet used to handle HTTP request and generate HTTP responses.. 	
	
	- hosted in a 'web container' , which is a component in a Java 'application server'( e.g, Apache Tomcat, Red Hat Jboss/WildFly, Oracle GlassFish, IBM WebSphere,
	  etc.)...
	
	- the service() method call is routed to a doXXX() call, depending on the HTTP request method, e.g., doGet(), doPost(), doHead(), doPut(), doDelete(), etc...
	
	- the doXXX() methods are passed two arguments:
		- HttpServletRequest
			- object representation of the HTTP request sent by the client and received by the servlet..

			- used to access information from the request message (e.g., HTTP request method, request URI, query string, message headers, message payload, etc..)..
		
		- HttpServletResponse
			- object representation of the HTTP response generated by the servlet and sent back to the requesting client..

			- used to set information in the response message (e.g., HTTP response status code,  message headers, message payload, etc..)..
			
		* the web container facilitates the conversation to and from the HTTP request/response messages to HttpServletRequest/HttpServletResponse..
